# Data_Science_Portfolio

# Project 1 (ongoing): Lab Work
*Created various statistical representations using real world data to determine the most accurate representation for use by an unsupervised machine learning model
*Built machine learning algorithms in both Python and MATLAB
*Handled migration from Google Colab to MATLAB which required restructuring of our codebase

# Project 2: Iris Flower
* Machine learning model used to predict particular species of the iris flower via input data
* Model is trained on the Iris flowert data set. 

# Project 3: Soccer Player Wages vs Values
*By cleaning and reformatting the wages and values columns from a database listing all current professional soccer playters I created a scatter plot with x,y as (wages, value) in order to determine which players are overvalued or undervalued. 
*Created an additional column that listed the difference of value - wage for each player in order to quantify the magnitute of their evaluations.
